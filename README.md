Data Description 

This j.son file is a corpus of various articles posted on social media regarding Coronavirus. This data set was submitted and cited by Ran Geva, but the articles in these files were written by various people. Related policy that this data can be useful for is understanding how the pubic reacts to disasters and the necessary fact-checking/censorship the government needs to pay attention to. The time frame of this corpus is from December 2019 – March 2020 and contains 10,956 entries and 5.2 million posts. The average length of the text is 3341 tokens, and the average number of replies is 1.63 replies. This data set contains data from over 50+ countries and most posted articles come from India, United States, Canada, and Denmark. Even though Coronavirus’s first case was discovered in China, China was surprisingly lower on this list of number of document entries.  

Interpretation of Data

	According to my analysis, the most frequent words are [‘china’, ‘said’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘virus]. I suspect that these are the most frequent words because this data was taken during the early phases of Covid, and the virus has not spread to other countries yet. So, many people were searching up China and how China was handling the outbreak at that time. 
	Bigrams are words that often occur together, I found that words that occur the most together was ‘world’ and ‘health’, ‘coronavirus’ and ‘outbreak’, ‘novel’ and ‘outbreak’, and ‘public’ and ‘health’. Again, this further solidifies my reasoning that this is a new(novel) disease, so people were looking at health information and listening to what health officials had to say about the status of the coronavirus outbreak.
